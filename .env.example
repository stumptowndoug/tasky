# Tasky Environment Configuration
#
# Copy this file to .env.local to customize your settings
# .env.local is already in .gitignore and won't be committed

# Tasks File Path (optional)
# ------------------------------
# Customize where your tasks are stored. Useful if you want tasks not included in git commits.
#
# Default: data/tasks.json (contains example data, committed to git)
#
# This environment variable is used by:
# - The Next.js web app (reads .env.local automatically)
# - The MCP server (reads .env.local via dotenv)
# - File watching system
#
# For personal use:
# 1. Copy this file to .env.local: cp .env.example .env.local
# 2. Uncomment and set the path below
# 3. Create your personal file: cp data/tasks.json data/my-tasks.json
# 4. Add your custom file to .gitignore
#
# Example: Use a personal tasks file (not committed to git)
# TASKS_FILE_PATH=data/my-tasks.json
#
# Then add to .gitignore:
# echo "data/my-tasks.json" >> .gitignore
#
# Note: After changing this, restart the dev server and any AI tools using the MCP server
